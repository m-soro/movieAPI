# Express App Using OMDb API
A very simple app that has a search form and shows results.
No styling or templates in this example.

## About OMDb API

- Sign up and get your API key.
- Use the docs to play around and construct your own search query!
- A sample query...
  ```
  http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt5726616&apikey=57483d04&plot=full&tomatoes=true
  ```

1. Install dependencies:
  - ```npm init```
  - ```npm install express request ejs --save```
  - **body-parser** is **not needed** here, as its **only needed to read HTTP POST data!**.


2. In the route where we have the form:  
  - ```method="GET"
  ``` the search term from the form input to be used as a variable in the request API like this:
    ```
    var query = request.query.<search>
    ```
  - where <search> is the name in your input's name.
  - append the ```query``` variable at the end of your request API, like this:
  ```
  http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=' + query + &apikey=57483d04
  ```

  **OR**

  - create a url variable to be passed on the request API like this:
    ```
    var url = `http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=${query}&apikey=57483d04`
    ```
  - then pass the ```url``` to request
